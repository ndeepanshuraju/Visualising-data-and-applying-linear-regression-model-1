# Visualising-data-and-applying-linear-regression-model-1
An Ecommerce company sells clothing online but they also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers come in to the store, have meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want.  The company is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website. So, here we learn how to visualise the data using data analysis tools and apply linear regression to help and solve the company's problem.
